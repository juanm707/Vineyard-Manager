# Vineyard Manager

Vineyard Manager is an easy way to manage your vineyards by having maps with labels of blocks, temperature and humidity sensors, which display the most recent readings, and any issues, if any, that need to be looked at.

Also included is an easy to view leaf water potential chart and table which display the stress levels throughout the season for the blocks.
